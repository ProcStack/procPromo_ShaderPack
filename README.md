### Creator's Notes
My first shader pack for Minecraft, it's been quite a journey.
<br>Since I had no footing for how to create for Optifine's environment, I looked towards 3 packs spcifically for learning from. *(Listed Below)*

I wanted to create the backbone for a general purpose shader pack. Some sort of short term project that requires features for future shader pack dev.
<br>Mojang's promotion art style feels really homely to me.
<br>Also a great first shader pack to shoot for!

Sure most of the look could have been achieved in a shader pack + texture pack combo, but decided it was less hastle to have a single pack to install and manage options for.

### Under the hood
Texture bluring along side an ever growing set of custom block and entity textures.
<br>A bluring/glow pass driven by a glow atlas texture.
<br>Edge highlights generated from depth and normal buffer data

---

### Inpiration Sources
Any Alt Textures from the atlases were generated from Minecraft using `texturedump v1.18.1` in Forge
<br>Then recreated or heavily modified and painted over.
<br>Asside from serveral custom blocks and entities, noise map, and glow map; all other art is acredited to Mojang.
